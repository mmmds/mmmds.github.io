   	<p>In this exercise we have credit card checking web application to exploit. It takes cred card number and returns information whether our card is compromised or not.</p>

<p>This VM can be found <a href="https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/luhn">here</a>.</p>

<p>Firstly, I tried to understand behavior of checking mechanism. I noticed that number has to be valid according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn algorithm</a>. For valid number (eg. <em>88888888</em>) I received “<em>We have no information that your CC has been compromised.</em>” and for invalid (eg. <em>12345</em>)  “<em>Invalid CC</em>”.</p>

<p>Behavior for odd number of digits is a little bit more complex. Application adds <em>0</em> at the end of the number, so for example both <em>5432193</em> and <em>54321930</em> works. I also found that every non digit character is just ignored by the validation mechanism, for example “<em>a 5 b 4 x 321!!930</em>” is still a valid number.</p>

<p>I assumed that when number is valid, application looks for it in database. I started to look for SQL Injection. I used what I had learned about this mechanism and prepared number “<em>543219’ or 3!=0 –</em>”. For validator it was still valid <em>54321930</em> but for SQL query the whole input was taken and I received “<em>Your CC has been compromised :/</em>”.

<p>Obviously, it was blind SQL injection which I had to exploit. I handcrafted my own <a href="https://github.com/mmmds/walkthroughs/blob/master/luhn/blind_luhn.py">script</a> to dump database. It uses Luhn algorithm to make sure that prepared query will be successfully validated on server side.
Key is stored in database.
